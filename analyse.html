                    <h2>Keyword research</h2>
                    <p>My website is international, and I choose to research keywords in English and limited the search to worldwide.</p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Shoe Store:</dt>
                        <dd>Over the past 12 months, these keywords have been used quite frequently together. The score varies slightly but remains around 60-70 out of 100.</dd>
                        <dt>Women's Shoes:</dt>
                        <dd>has remained fairly stable at around 70 points over the past 12 months. This also increases somewhat in November/December for the past 5 years.</dd>
                        <dt>Men's shoes: </dt>
                        <dd>Stays above 70 points within a 12-month perspective. It is now around 60, but when I look at the past five years, the trend has increased dramatically at the end of November/December. This is a time we are entering, and I will definitely include this keyword.</dd>
                        <dt>Vans:</dt>
                        <dd>Has risen significantly in recent months. This is a keyword that has gained a lot of popularity in the last 6 months. 6 months ago, "Vans" was at 10-20 points, but in the past half-year, it has increased and remained around 80-100.</dd>
                        <dt>Adidas:</dt>
                        <dd>Has risen significantly in recent months. This is a keyword that has gained a lot of popularity in the last 6 months. 6 months ago, "Vans" was at 10-20 points, but in the past half-year, it has increased and remained around 80-100.</dd>
                        <dt>Affordable shoes:</dt>
                        <dd>Over the past 12 months, it has been around 70-100 points. I think the trend will not decrease much in the next year, considering that most goods have increased in price, and this is something people will search for.</dd>
                        <dt>Comfortable:</dt>
                        <dd> It's a keyword that has been above 80 points for the past 6 months and seems like a popular trend that also fits with shoes.</dd>
                        <dt>Running shoes:</dt>
                        <dd>Over the past year, it has ranged between 80-100 points and seems like a good and stable trend. This is probably something many people search for.</dd>
                        <dt>Boots:</dt>
                        <dd>It's a keyword that for most of the year is under 50 points over the course of a year. Every November/December, it increases dramatically in searches to 70-90. This is a keyword I would include from now until Christmas.</dd>
                        <dt>Discount shoes:</dt>
                        <dd>Over the past year, it has been over 70-90 and seems like a popular keyword to search for.</dd>
                        <dt>Winter shoes:</dt>
                        <dd>It is also something that is often searched for during the holiday season.</dd>

                        navigation. Both ChatGPT and Webaim stress the importance of reviewing my 
                        headings. ChatGPT suggests testing with screen readers, removing unnecessary
                        elements, providing alt text for icons, and adding labels.I didn't gain much insight from 
                        the Lighthouse analysis. Webaim provided me with specific actions, as did ChatGPT.</p>

                    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
                    <p>I tested NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) on my website to see how it performed. 
                        Initially, navigating the site with this method and the keyboard felt unfamiliar,
                        but surprisingly, it went smoothly over time. I could use the tab key to reach all the 
                        links on the page. I closed my eyes and managed to navigate to where I wanted. It was a 
                        bit challenging when the screen reader spoke Norwegian and my website is in English, 
                        but I addressed this in the settings.</p>
                    <p>I implemented a 'Skip to content' link for screen readers, and I think it works well. 
                        I used the example from https://bignerdranch.com/blog/web-accessibility-skip-navigation-links/.
                        When I started adding ARIA to the document, I noticed that NVDA only read the text
                        and not the ARIA. So, I tried Windows' built-in screen reader, but it only read the ARIA
                        and not the text. Finally, I downloaded Chrome Vox as an extension for Chrome. 
                        It worked well with both text and ARIA, so I used it to determine where to place ARIA.</p>

                    <h2>Measures taken to increase SEO and UU</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I removed the button tag from cookies and contact icons.</li>
                        <li>Provided alt text to icons that have a function.</li>
                        <li>Removed alt text from icons and added aria-label since HTML-validator told me to.</li>
                        <li>I fixed the heading level in footer to get better structure.</li>
                        <li>Fixed "login" icon that was categorized as an "empty link". Wrapped it in span, added aria hidden true, and a "go to login site" text that is accessible to screen readers.</li>
                        <li>Changed the alt text on all images to be more detailed.</li>
                        <li>I have not fixed the "reduntant link" issue because it's not a complete functional website.</li>
                        <li>Tested three different screen readers on my site with eyes closed, while using keyboard. Used NVDA, Chrome Vox and Windows screen reader.</li>
                        <li>Added ARIA labels, roles to elements that needed it and kept testing with screen reader</li>
                        <li>Added a "Skip to content" shortcut for screen readers</li>
                        <li>Added microdata to product site and testet it with rich results test. Fixed errors that occured after test.</li>
                        <li>Added meta-description and changed title text.</li>
                        <li>Added meta data for Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Tiktok. Checked if they worked</li>

                        <p>I achieved a much better score on the last analysis. I reached 100 on SEO for all my pages!
                            My score improved when I fixed structural errors, made my site universally 
                            designed to reach a broader user base by adding ARIA. I obtained a better score by 
                            adding microdata, allowing search engines to interpret the page more effectively. 
                            Additionally, I saw improved results after adding metadata for social media, making it 
                            easier to promote my site on social platforms.
